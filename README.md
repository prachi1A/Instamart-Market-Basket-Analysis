to increase their profits and business by satisfying their customers' requests and
attracting new consumers based on their wants. Identifying customers and addressing
their individual needs is a difficult and time consuming endeavour .

homogeneous groups. The data employed in the customer segmentation technique,
which divides customers into groups, is influenced by a variety of elements such as data
geographical conditions, economic conditions, demographic conditions, and behavioural
patterns.

The customer segmentation technique enables businesses to make better use of their
marketing budgets, acquire a competitive advantage over their competitors, and
demonstrate a deeper understanding of the demands of the customer.

opportunities, developing a stronger brand strategy, and identifying client retention.
