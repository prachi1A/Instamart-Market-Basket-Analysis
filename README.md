# Instamart-Market-Basket-Analysis
As the business world has become more competitive over the years, businesses have had
to increase their profits and business by satisfying their customers' requests and
attracting new consumers based on their wants. Identifying customers and addressing
their individual needs is a difficult and time consuming endeavour .

Customer segmentation is a marketing approach that divides a market into
homogeneous groups. The data employed in the customer segmentation technique,
which divides customers into groups, is influenced by a variety of elements such as data
geographical conditions, economic conditions, demographic conditions, and behavioural
patterns.

The customer segmentation technique enables businesses to make better use of their
marketing budgets, acquire a competitive advantage over their competitors, and
demonstrate a deeper understanding of the demands of the customer.

It also aids a firm in enhancing marketing efficiency, recognising new market
opportunities, developing a stronger brand strategy, and identifying client retention.

# Problem Statement and Steps of the solution
•We try to find a possible customer segmenetation enabling to classify
customers according the their different purchases.

•Since there are thousands of products in the dataset we rely on aisles, which
represent categories of products.

•As the aisles features are too many, we use Principal Component Analysis to
find new dimensions which will help with clustering.

•We will then try to find possible interpretation for the identified clusters.
# Results and analysis of the solution
We observed that the products that were sold the most:

1.fresh fruits

2.fresh vegetables

3.packaged vegetables fruits

4.yogurt

5.packaged cheese

6.milk

7.water seltzer sparkling water

8.chips pretzels

The following can be said about the customer behaviour of different clusters by looking
at the results:

▪People of cluster 1 buy more fresh vegetables than the other clusters.

▪Cluster 1 is also the cluster including those customers buying far more goods than any
others.

▪People of cluster 2 buy more yogurt than people of the other clusters.

▪People of cluster 3 buy a Lot of 'Baby Food Formula' which not even listed in the top 8
products but mainly characterize this cluster. With this observation we can safely
assume they buy more milk than the others.
